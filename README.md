**ATTENTION: I made this bot by using the new rewrite version of [discord.py v1.7+](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), and the [discord-py-slash-command v1.2.2](https://github.com/LordOfPolls/discord-py-slash-command) lib. I am currently self hosting this bot on an [Raspberry PI4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) but you can take a look on the code and implement it the way you want it.**

This bot is an all arounder so you can use it for management, music, and other things. I will keep commiting new changes since its the project i am currently working on.

Modules that are used are:

`pip install discord.py` (rewrite, v1.7+)
`pip install discord-py-slash-command` (v1.2.2)
`pip install youtube_dl` (v2021.5.16, since the bot also works as a music bot)
`pip install pynacl` (v1.4.0)
`pip install request` (if you dont have it already installed)
`pip install psutil`

Command List
------------
**Info:** The preset prefix is `<` but you can change it via the command `<current_prefix>prefix<new_prefix>`
